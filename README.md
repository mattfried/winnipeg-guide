City of Winnipeg Guide project Website

The City of Winnipeg Guide is a single page website showcasing some of the cityâ€™s best food, drinks, and sporting events. This is a practice project for an online web development course.

I originally structured the webpage by using floats for the header navigation and main content columns, but later changed to using flexbox upon learning the concepts. From here on out I've been using flexbox in all of my projects because of its efficiency and ease of future editing where necessary.

I incorporated Google Maps via JavaScript through Google's API.

Portions of the design elements were provided in an online web development course.
